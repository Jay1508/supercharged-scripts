## Usage ##

**cygwin-mirrors-speed-tester (Python)**: a python script that pings all the Cygwin Mirrors from the Official Mirrors list and shows you the Top 5 mirrors to download from. Thanks to *Dmitry Sidorenko* for the script. Useful when you want to select the best mirror for downloading packages for Cygwin.

> Just extract/download the project and run `python speed.py` from the directory
