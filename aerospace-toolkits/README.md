## Usage ##

**1. aerospace-toolkits / airfoil-generator (MATLAB)**: a MATLAB GUI Script that can easily generate and plot NACA 4 Series Airfoil. A csv file containing the airfoil co-ordinates can also be generated. Useful for aerospace, aerodynamics, fluid mechanics.

> Just extract/download the project and open AirfoilGenerator.m in MATLAB (after switching into that directory)
