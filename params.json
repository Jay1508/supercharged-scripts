Hope it's useful for you too.\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n\r\n**1. nmap-bulk-ip-port-scanner (PHP Script)**: a php script to scan a list of ip addresses against a set of ports. The script logs ip addresses that have one of the specified list of ports open. Useful for network scanning and detection of specific types of servers (printers, IP cameras, etc). \r\n\r\n> Don't forget to run\r\n> `composer update` from the root of the nmap-bulk-ip-port-scanner directory to load dependencies.\r\n\r\n**[Try it out >>](https://github.com/niranjan94/supercharged-scripts/tree/master/nmap-bulk-ip-port-scanner)**\r\n\r\n**2. email-id-extractor (HTML/javascript)**: a small javascript code with a Bootstrap 3 UI to extract all email ID's from a string. Useful for data extraction.\r\n\r\n> Just extract/download the project and open index.html to use\r\n\r\n**[Try it out >>](https://github.com/niranjan94/supercharged-scripts/tree/master/email-id-extractor)**\r\n\r\n**3. aerospace-toolkits / airfoil-generator (MATLAB)**: a MATLAB GUI Script that can easily generate and plot NACA 4 Series Airfoil. A csv file containing the airfoil co-ordinates can also be generated. Useful for aerospace, aerodynamics, fluid mechanics.\r\n\r\n> Just extract/download the project and open AirfoilGenerator.m in MATLAB (after switching into that directory)\r\n\r\n**[Try it out >>](https://github.com/niranjan94/supercharged-scripts/tree/master/aerospace-toolkits/airfoil-generator)**\r\n\r\n**4. aerospace-toolkits / stress-calculator (MATLAB)**: a MATLAB GUI Script that can be used to calculate stress at each point in a web-stringer arrangement on giving the stringer co-ordinates, areas and moment value (if any). Useful for Mechanics of Material, Aircraft Structures.\r\n\r\n> Just extract/download the project and open StressCalc.m in MATLAB (after switching into that directory)\r\n\r\n**[Try it out >>](https://github.com/niranjan94/supercharged-scripts/tree/master/aerospace-toolkits/stress-calculator)**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
